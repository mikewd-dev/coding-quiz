# coding-quiz

## Description
- This application I made is a coding quiz application which presents a series of multiple choice questions to the user and presents a final score at the end. There is also a list of highscores.

- I used javascript, html and css to create this application.

- I learned aboout using local storage. Using functions to handle different parts of the application. These include to such things setting a timer and use of event listeners.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the coding quiz application go to https://mikewd-dev.github.io/coding-quiz/ and click on the start quiz button.You will then be taken to first question and the timer at the top right will begin to count down. Click on any of the buttons as your answer and you'll be then taken to the next question. For each wrong answer you will be penalized 10 seconds. The quiz ends if the questions are all answered or the timer reaches zero.You will be presented with a screen to enter your initals and submit.The hughscores page will appear with the list of scores and the users' initials.

There is also the option to clear the scoresor to go back to the beginning of the application to try again.
